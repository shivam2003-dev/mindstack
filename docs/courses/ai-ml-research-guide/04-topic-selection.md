### Step 3: Identify Problem

Find specific problem to solve.

**Example**: "Improving small object detection"

### Step 4: Formulate Question

Create specific research question.

**Example**: "How can we improve small object detection accuracy using attention mechanisms?"

### Step 5: Define Scope

Clearly define what's in and out of scope.

**Example**: 
- **In scope**: Small objects (< 32x32 pixels), attention mechanisms
- **Out of scope**: Large objects, other architectures

!!! tip "Refinement Tips"
    - Start broad, narrow gradually
    - Be specific but not too narrow
    - Ensure feasibility
    - Get feedback from advisors
