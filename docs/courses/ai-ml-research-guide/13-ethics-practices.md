## Research Misconduct

### Types of Misconduct

**1. Fabrication**:
- Making up data
- Inventing results
- Creating false evidence

**2. Falsification**:
- Manipulating data
- Changing results
- Omitting data
- Misrepresenting findings

**3. Plagiarism**:

- Using others' work
- Self-plagiarism
- Inadequate citation

!!! warning "Misconduct Consequences"
    Research misconduct has serious consequences:
    - Career damage
    - Loss of credibility
    - Legal issues
    - Harm to field

### Avoiding Misconduct

**Best Practices**:
- Always cite sources
- Report honestly
- Don't manipulate data

!!! tip "Avoiding Misconduct"
    When in doubt, ask. Better to be cautious than violate ethics.

## Authorship and Credit

### Authorship Criteria

**ICMJE Criteria**:
1. Substantial contributions to conception/design
2. Drafting or revising article
3. Final approval of version
4. Agreement to be accountable

!!! note "Authorship"
    All authors must meet all criteria. Discuss authorship early.

### Authorship Order

**Conventions**:
- **First author**: Primary contributor
- **Last author**: Senior/advisor
- **Middle authors**: Alphabetical or by contribution

**Best Practices**:
- Discuss order early
- Be fair
- Document contributions
- Use CRediT taxonomy

!!! tip "Authorship"
    - Discuss early and openly
    - Be fair about contributions
    - Document contributions
    - Resolve conflicts professionally

### Acknowledgment

**Acknowledge**:
- Funding sources
- Data providers
- Computing resources
- Helpful discussions
- Reviewers (if appropriate)

!!! success "Acknowledgment"
    Proper acknowledgment shows professionalism and gratitude.

## Data Ethics

### Data Collection

**Ethical Practices**:
- Informed consent
- Privacy protection
- Data minimization

- Test fairness

!!! note "Bias"
    All data has bias. Acknowledge and address it.

## Reproducibility

### Why Reproducibility Matters

**Benefits**:
- Verifies results
- Enables extension
- Builds trust
- Advances science
- Required by many venues

!!! success "Reproducibility"
    Make your research reproducible. It's ethical and good practice.

### Reproducibility Practices

**Code**:
- Share code
- Document well
- Version control
- Clear instructions

**Data**:
- Share when possible
- Document thoroughly
- Provide access
- Respect privacy

**Experiments**:
- Document setup
- Report all details
- Multiple runs
- Statistical analysis

## Responsible AI Research

### Considerations

**1. Impact Assessment**:
- Potential benefits
- Potential harms
- Who benefits?
- Who might be harmed?

**2. Fairness**:
- Fair to all groups
- No discrimination
- Equal access
- Bias mitigation

**3. Transparency**:
- Explain methods
- Document limitations
- Share code/data
- Clear communication

**4. Safety**:
- Test thoroughly
- Consider misuse
- Security measures
- Risk assessment

!!! warning "Responsible AI"
    Consider broader impact. Research can have real-world consequences.

## Best Practices

### Research Practices

**1. Planning**:

### Collaboration

**Best Practices**:
- Clear communication
- Fair contributions
- Respect differences
- Resolve conflicts
- Support each other

!!! note "Collaboration"
    Good collaboration enhances research. Poor collaboration harms it.

## Common Ethical Issues

### Issue 1: P-hacking

**Problem**: Manipulating analysis to get significant results

**Solution**: Pre-register analysis plan, report all tests

!!! warning "P-hacking"
    Don't manipulate analysis. Report all results honestly.

### Issue 2: HARKing

**Problem**: Hypothesizing After Results Known

**Solution**: Formulate hypotheses before experiments

### Issue 3: Selective Reporting

**Problem**: Only reporting positive results

**Solution**: Report all results, including failures

### Issue 4: Inadequate Citation

**Problem**: Not citing properly

**Solution**: Cite all sources, use proper format

!!! tip "Ethical Issues"
    Be aware of common issues. Avoid them proactively.
