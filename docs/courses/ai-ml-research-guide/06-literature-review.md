## What is a Literature Review?

A **literature review** is a comprehensive survey of existing research in your area. It:

- Summarizes existing work
- Identifies gaps and opportunities
- Positions your research
- Provides theoretical foundation
- Shows your understanding of the field

!!! note "Literature Review Importance"
    A good literature review:
    - Demonstrates your knowledge
    - Justifies your research
    - Helps avoid duplication
    - Identifies research gaps
    - Guides your research direction

## Types of Literature Reviews

### 1. Narrative Review

**Purpose**: Broad overview of field

**Characteristics**:
- Thematic organization
- Qualitative synthesis
- Broad coverage
- Less systematic

**Use**: General understanding, introduction sections

### 2. Systematic Review

**Purpose**: Comprehensive, systematic analysis

**Characteristics**:
- Systematic search
- Explicit criteria
- Quantitative synthesis
- Reproducible

**Use**: Comprehensive analysis, survey papers

!!! tip "Systematic Reviews"
    More rigorous but time-consuming. Use for important reviews.

### 3. Meta-Analysis

**Purpose**: Statistical synthesis of results

**Characteristics**:
- Quantitative analysis
- Statistical methods
- Effect size calculation
- Comprehensive

**Use**: When multiple studies exist on same topic

## Literature Review Process

### Step 1: Define Scope

**Questions to Answer**:
- What is the research question?
- What time period to cover?
- What types of papers?
- What languages?
- What venues?

!!! tip "Scope Definition"
    Start broad, then narrow. Better to include more initially.

### Step 2: Search Strategy

**Search Components**:
- **Keywords**: Main terms
- **Databases**: Where to search
- **Filters**: Time, type, language
- **Boolean operators**: AND, OR, NOT

**Example Search**:
```
("object detection" OR "object recognition") 
AND ("deep learning" OR "neural network")
AND ("small objects" OR "tiny objects")
```

!!! note "Search Iteration"
    Refine searches based on results. Try different keyword combinations.

### Step 3: Paper Collection

**Sources**:

    - Focus on quality over quantity
    - Use reference managers
    - Organize systematically

### Step 4: Screening

**Criteria**:
- Relevance to research question
- Quality of work
- Recency (if relevant)
- Venue quality

**Process**:
1. Title/abstract screening
2. Full-text screening
3. Final selection

    - Use inclusion/exclusion criteria
    - Document decisions
    - Get second opinion if unsure
    - Keep rejected papers for reference

### Step 5: Reading and Analysis

**For Each Paper**:
- Read carefully
- Take detailed notes
- Extract key information
- Identify contributions
- Note limitations

**Information to Extract**:
- Problem addressed
- Method proposed
- Key contributions
- Results achieved
- Limitations
- Future work

### Step 6: Synthesis

**Organize by**:
- Chronological order
- Thematic groups
- Methodological approaches

2. Thematic sections
3. Comparison and analysis
4. Gaps and opportunities
5. Summary

## Search Strategies

### Keyword Development

**Process**:
1. Start with main terms
2. Find synonyms
3. Use controlled vocabularies
4. Check paper keywords
5. Refine iteratively

- Your research question
- Related papers
- Subject headings
- Thesauri
- Expert input

!!! tip "Keyword Tips"
    - Use both specific and general terms
    - Include acronyms

### Database Selection

**Primary Databases**:
- Google Scholar
- Semantic Scholar
- arXiv
- Conference proceedings
- Journal databases

**Specialized**:
- Papers With Code (for implementations)
- DBLP (computer science)
- ACM Digital Library
- IEEE Xplore

!!! note "Multiple Databases"
    Search multiple databases. Each has different coverage.

### Citation Chaining

**Forward Chaining**:
- Papers that cite your paper
- Shows influence and extensions

**Backward Chaining**:
- Papers cited by your paper
- Shows foundation and related work

**Tools**:
- Google Scholar "Cited by"
- Semantic Scholar citations
- Connected Papers

!!! success "Citation Chaining"
    Excellent way to find related work. Follow citation chains systematically.

## Organizing Literature

### Thematic Organization

**Structure**:
```
Literature Review
├── Introduction
├── Theme 1: Method A
│   ├── Paper 1
│   ├── Paper 2
│   └── Comparison
├── Theme 2: Method B
│   ├── Paper 3
│   ├── Paper 4
│   └── Comparison
├── Theme 3: Applications
└── Gaps and Opportunities
```

### Chronological Organization

**Structure**:
```
Literature Review
├── Early Work (2010-2015)
├── Recent Advances (2016-2020)
├── Current State (2021-present)
