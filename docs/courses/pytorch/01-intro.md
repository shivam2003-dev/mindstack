# Introduction to PyTorch

Welcome to the PyTorch course! In this first lesson, we'll introduce you to PyTorch and help you understand why it's one of the most popular deep learning frameworks.

## What is PyTorch?

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It's known for:

- **Dynamic computation graphs**: Build and modify neural networks on the fly
- **Pythonic design**: Feels natural to Python developers
- **Strong community**: Extensive documentation and active community
- **Research-friendly**: Widely used in academic research

## Why Learn PyTorch?

```python
import torch

# Simple tensor creation
x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
print(x)
```

!!! tip "Tip"
    PyTorch tensors are similar to NumPy arrays but with GPU acceleration support.

## Key Concepts

In this course, you'll learn:

1. **Tensors**: The fundamental data structure
2. **Automatic Differentiation**: How PyTorch computes gradients
3. **Neural Networks**: Building and training models
4. **Optimization**: Training techniques and best practices

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- Basic Python knowledge
- Understanding of NumPy (helpful but not required)
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts (recommended)

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, we'll dive deep into tensors and learn how to manipulate them.
